# Spin Up CAD Repo -- VEX CAD Inventor 1.3.0

This is the CAD for all the swerve modules from version 1 to 5, 
and the Spin Up 18" robot for the GUARD VEX U team.

## PROTECTED INFORMATION

Any information of, or suggestions regarding, GUARD's swerve development
should not be given to any other VEX teams (apart from 34565A), and the
project should be considered "secret" until the club executive committee 
agree to the release of the information, which should be some time on
competition week.

Some reasons are:

- Knowledge about other teams' drivetrains provide a competitive advantage
which could impact the result of the competition,
- Swerve is a high-effort, high-reward endeavour. Leaked information,
software, or CAD files lowers the barrier of entry and reduces our advantage.
files would
- It would be kind of embarassing if they expected to see a swerve robot
but we ended up not being able to do it lol

## Folders, versions

- **guardSwerve1** was the very first prototype swerve module. It was very
large and impractical, but it proved the concept of a differential swerve.

- **guardSwerve2** was the second prototype, which was designed to be very
compact. It had some problems, and inherently could not be geared for a 
fast enough speed.

- **guardSwerve 3 & 4** were preliminary sketches of redesigns that I
couldn't be bothered to delete.

- **guardSwerve5** is the current major revision of the swerve design,
featuring wider wheel capacity, similar footprint to the guardSwerve2, 
wider gearing configurations, and more stable slew bearing setup.

- **spin-up-18_1** is the first major version of the 18" robot design.

- **VEX-CAD-Inventor-1.3.0.zip** is a copy of a public VEX CAD library.
It is outdated, but versions are incompatible with each other so it makes
most sense to port to a new repo if we want to change.
